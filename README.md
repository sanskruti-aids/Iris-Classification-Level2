# Iris-Classification-Level2
Level 2 – Machine Learning Classification using Logistic Regression and Random Forest on Iris Dataset

## Internship: Codveda Technologies

**Project Description:
This project was completed as part of my Data Science Internship.

In this Level 2 task, I built machine learning classification models to predict the species of Iris flowers.

**Tasks Completed:
- Logistic Regression Classification
- Random Forest Classification
- Model Evaluation using Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix Analysis

** Tools & Technologies:
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

** Outcome:
Both models achieved high accuracy due to the clean and well-structured nature of the Iris dataset.
